<h1 align="center">Hudson Yards Redevelopment</h1>
<img src="images/three.jpg" alt="Hudson Yards" class="lt-responsive">
<p>Hudson Yards is the largest private real estate development in the history of the United States and the largest development in New York City since Rockefeller Center. The site will include more than 18 million square feet of commercial and residential space, state-of-the-art office towers, more than 100 shops including New York’s first Neiman Marcus, and a collection of restaurants curated by Chef Thomas Keller. The urban development will include approximately 4,000 residences, The Shed, a new center for artistic invention, 14 acres of public open space, a 750-seat public school and an Equinox Hotel® with more than 200 rooms—all offering unparalleled amenities for residents, employees and guests. The development of Hudson Yards will create more than 23,000 construction jobs.</p>
<p>Hudson Yards is the fulfillment of a remarkable collaboration that includes a talented group of visionaries – planners, architects, engineers, designers, public servants, fashion icons, renowned chefs, business leaders, luminaries and more. They are working in partnership with New York’s development and transportation authorities, and with some of the world’s most iconic retail brands and leading companies – each of whom will call Hudson Yards home.</p>

<p>Constructed on 28- acres over a working rail yard, two “platforms” bridge over 30 active train tracks, three rail tunnels and the new Gateway Tunnel. 300 caissons support the platforms and buildings. The caissons (four to five feet in diameter and 20 to 80 feet in depth) are drilled deep into the bedrock between existing tracks. Finished towers extend from the caisson foundations, through the platforms, and then rise skyward.
This eastern portion of the platform will use 25,000 tons of steel, 14,000 cubic yards of concrete and weigh more than 35,000 tons. Caisson drilling started in March 2014 and the platform was completed in 2015. Throughout construction the trains have remained operational, and the new No. 7 Subway extension opened at Hudson Yards in 2015.</p>
