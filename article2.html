<h1 align="center">Hudson Yards History</h1>

<p>The	area	known	as	Hudson	Yards	encompasses	360	acres	on	the	Far	West	Side	of
Manhattan.	Hudson	Yards	is	roughly	defined	by	West	28th	Street	to	the	south,	Seventh	and
Eighth	Avenues	to	the	east,	West	43rd	Street	to	the	north,	and	the	Hudson	River	to	the
west.</p>

<p>For	decades,	Hudson	Yards	elicited	the	attention	of	previous	government	officials	and
developers	as	it	remained	underdeveloped	compared	to	neighboring	communities.	In	1969,
the	Lindsay	administration	put	forward	a	plan	to	expand	Manhattan’s	commercial	business
district	to	the	Hudson	River.	In	1994,	the	Giuliani	administration	planned	to	bring	the
Yankees	and	the	2008	Olympics	to	a	proposed	stadium	on	the	West	Side.	However,	the
area’s	redevelopment	remained	elusive	until	the	Bloomberg	Administration’s	proposal	to
rezone	the	area	for	mixed-use	development	linked	to	the	city’s	(failed)	bid	to	host	the	2012
Olympics.</p>

<br>
<p>The	Bloomberg	Administration	argued	that	Hudson	Yards	needed	to	be	redeveloped	as	an
office	district	to	protect	and	increase	the	city’s	share	of	the	regional	market	for	commercial
space.	This	assertion	was	supported	by	a	2003	study	by	consultants	Economics	Research
Associates	and	Cushman	&	Wakefield	showing	Midtown’s	share	of	occupied	office	space
was	decreasing	despite	increasing	demand	in	the	New	York	region (Economics	Research
Associates	and	Cushman	&	Wakefield	2003).	The	cause	was	cited	as	insufficient	office
development	space.	Hudson	Yards'	proximity	to	Midtown	offered	the	opportunity	to
capture	growth	in	the	office	market	by	extending	the	historic	appeal	of	the	city’s	premier
business	center	west (Cushman	&	Wakefield	2006).</p>
